## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sayed Sadat 

I'm a software engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science and Analytics at the University of Calgary. I am a perfectionist but I also keep an eye on being pragmatic and efficient. My biggest passion in life is problem solving which has led me to the top 200 chess puzzle solvers in Canada <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Flag_of_Canada_(Pantone).svg" alt= "Canadian Flag" width = 16 height = 16>
